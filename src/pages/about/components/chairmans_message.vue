          Dear Friends, <pre></pre> <b> It takes a warm handshake to become part of a deeply
          transformative political process. </b> <pre></pre> Many years have been invested in the
          construction of the AFRICAN DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS, ADC, as a model of
          sustainable political platform. Luckily, the Party has become the
          fastest growing political party in Nigeria. This journey has exposed
          the weaknesses within the nation’s political firmament, and our
          nation-building efforts. We in ADC have learned from our own failings,
          and from the failures within the greater ecosystems of partisanship
          and political practice in the country. The deafening noise, the lack
          of patriotism, the corruption, high-handedness, injustices,
          divisiveness, and marginalization, have been as a result of leadership
          myopia, and elite hypocrisy. Effective transformational leadership
          with knowledge-driven protocols are the elixirs to our nation-building
          enterprise. <pre></pre> The ADC nation building, governance, and Call to Action
          frame-works begin with a warm handshake, and learning and living the
          disciplines of the ADC role-modelling leadership paradigm. The culture
          of the handshake is enlivening, builds bridges, expands borders and
          inspires creativity and the relational agility that opens our world to
          limitless opportunities. Leaders who are intent on inspiring action
          from their followers and colleagues by modelling the role they expect
          of others, are highly ethical, thoughtful, mindful, and are inherent
          part of building a new horizon. This kind of leadership climate
          inspires selflessness and the best public spirited results. I am sure
          this is the kind of political platform you would like to join. <pre></pre> Are you
          proud of your situation, the state of your community, local council,
          state, Nigeria, Africa, and even the world community as they are
          today? Most especially, what do you want to change in your immediate
          vicinity? <pre></pre> You do not have to answer. But do not be held captive by the
          past or present. SUNK COSTS, like spilt milk, CAN ONLY STINK until one
          decides to move on. We can complain about failed projects, wasted
          opportunities, the divisiveness, the stench of corruption, and
          injustices around us to no end. Please do not stand aloof, or remain
          passive, or take an opportunistic stance, or decide to jump into the
          bazaar. However you may feel, I believe you can still make a
          difference. <pre></pre> Whatever your thoughts or dreams may be, I recommend you
          start by extending that symbolic and genuine handshake to persons
          within your immediate environment. Extend this warmth within your
          community. It is not about money. It is about participation, about
          organizing, and about leadership, and it is about doing so in an
          authentic and inclusive manner. ADC has a lot of outreach programs
          designed to hone your skills. <pre></pre> Are you a professional: a doctor, or
          lawyer, a sports personality, entrepreneur, trader, or mechanic? Can
          you volunteer your services, skills or time to serve and empower
          others, to inspire, guide, mentor colleagues and younger people, to
          leverage your space? Have you identified causes that you are endeared
          to? You can impact your space by whatever skills you have. Obama was
          involved in community organizing, Mandela was involved in activism and
          liberation movement, Zik and Nkrumah were involved in independence
          movements. In our society today many causes abound: the environment,
          organizing lessons for out-of-school kids, literacy program for
          traders and artisans, providing help for elders, medical emergencies
          and outreaches, legal aids, reading reactivation, and change advocacy.
          Volunteerism and relational agility are critical for anyone who hopes
          to be successful in public service. <pre></pre> Whatever your background, you can
          do something. You are a HANDSHAKE away from activating the journey of
          leading your dream, and fulfilling a destiny call in serving the
          people, our government, country, and humanity. Feel free, join this
          political movement. I am sure you will become a great thinker, a
          revolutionary and positive change-maker, an accomplished public
          servant. Joining ADC might just be your epiphany. <pre></pre> I specially invite
          you to volunteer to be a significant part of this transformative
          political process championed by my party the African Democratic
          Congress, ADC, so that Nigeria will Arise and Shine. ADC is anchored
          on Inclusion, it will be a privilege to have you and many of your
          friends join us in this journey. We aim to build the most dynamic,
          people centered, progressive, and transformative political
          organization. Let’s Go to Work. You belong with us; Arise and shine! <pre></pre>
          ADC , Arise!; ADC, Arise!!; AD&C, Arise and Shine Nigeria.  <pre></pre>
